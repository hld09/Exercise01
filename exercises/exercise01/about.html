	Hey, I’m Romeo… I live in Italy. I’m single now ladies-- Juliet however, is in a better place. I know, I’ve practically got a shrine to her on my homepage, but that’s what happens when your girlfriend dies. No matter how much I love you, her ghost will always come first. Sorry not sorry.
	<br><br>
	Now let me give you the lowdown. If you end up getting all the way through this, we can run off in exile together and live a happy life. That’s the ultimate dream… right?
	<br><br>
	Anyway, once upon a time, I met this amazing girl at a party I snuck into because I was sort of in love with her cousin, but then I met <b>her</b>... and she was so hot, even her soul was hot too. We really just vibed, you know how it is when it feels right. So then I was like,“Yo, I kinda wanna marry you,” and she was all like,“Yeah idk who you are bc we're all wearing masks, but I kinda dig you too…”<br><br> BUT THEN (here’s the real kicker) she was from the family my parents <b>HATED</b>. I’m sure you know as well as I do that you can’t just go around disappointing mom and pop, but I couldn’t help myself. You know it's real when you're willing to say,"Screw my parents," for some rando girl you just met.
	<br><br>
	So that night, after the party wrapped up, I told her I’d meet her at her balcony. So I climbed up this tree next to her window (which I would NOT recommend because I was definitely not smelling my freshest by the time I got up), and scaled a wall, with the help of my cousin (he’s a bro, you probably know him, Mercutio--?) to woo this chick. Juliet couldn’t see me at first because she kept saying,"Where for art thou Romeo," and I'm like "Girl, I'm right here, ya boi is here!" Tbh I think something must have gotten in her contacts. Anyways, we confessed we wanted to marry each other AGAIN and then came up with a plan how to do it.
	<br><br>
	But it took a turn for the worst...don’t ask how, but I ended up having to kill her cousin after he killed mine, so our families were definitely never gonna be okay with us getting married. After going through all these obstacles, we realized the only option was to fake our deaths after I got kicked out of Verona.
	<br><br>
 	Somewhere along the line a little miscommunication happened and I thought Jules really <b>was</b> dead... so I stabbed myself (and survived)... but she thought I was dead so <i>she</i> stabbed herself too (spoiler alert: she didn't *sadface* ). Now that’s why I’m here. I can’t be alone forever.
	<br><br>
	If this doesn’t completely scare you off-- let’s go on a date… preferably in some other country away from Verona or even Italy. You know where to find me.
	<br><br>

	Xoxo Romeo
