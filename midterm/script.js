  "description":"The bantha is a colossal, shaggy, mammalian mount with circular ram-like horns. Herds of bantha inhabit the desert wastes of Tatooine in the outer Rim, as well as grasslands and plains of other worlds throughout the Star Wars galaxy. They are very sociable animals, have long sticky tongues to catch prey, and are notorious for their smell. Since bantha are found in such a large number of agricultural systems, it is believed that early space settlers transported the species to new worlds. Although largely domesticated, on some planets wild herds can still be found. There are several known varieties of banthas in existence, including the common bantha (Bantha majorus), the smaller, shy dwarf bantha, and the rangier, slender dune bantha. One specific subtype of bantha is the Kashyyyk greyclimber, which differs in that the greyclimber has massive cranial bone plates in place of horns; it has also adapted to climbing through the evolution of articulated toes that can grip wroshyr trees. Banthas can be seen in video games and the movie Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. They were commonly used on Tatooine by the Tusken Raiders."

  "description":"Tauntauns are 2.5 m (8.2 ft) tall bipedal reptiles, indigenous to the ice planet Hoth. Tauntauns are covered with white fur and have downturned horns, four nostrils, and a foul body odor. They subsist off lichen found in hoarfrost as well as eating mushrooms and other fungi found in ice caves. They give birth to two young at a time, twice in one Hoth year, although triplet Tauntauns are considered incredibly good luck and are often born with purple fur. They are used as mounts by the Rebel Alliance, and have been exported offworld to other cold-climate regions (including Coruscant's polar caps) for use as mounts, beasts of burden, and tourist attractions. Their thick layers of fat and fur provide adequate protection from the cold during the daytime, but tauntauns cannot survive the plummeting night temperatures without shelter. Tauntauns are sometimes preyed upon by the Wampa."},{"name":"Mynock","image":"http://www.loresdelsith.net/universo/aliens/bin/mynock04.jpg","description":"A mynock is a leathery-looking silicon-based organism that grows up to 1.6 m (5.25 ft) long, with a wingspan of up to 1.25 m (4.1 ft), and that feeds on electrical energy. They are often found leeching power from spacecraft, as mynocks are one of the few species capable of living in the vacuum of space, feeding on stellar radiation, silicon and other minerals from asteroids and other space debris. Mynocks' bat-like wings also allow them to fly in the atmosphere. They are known to reproduce by mitosis. Found across the galaxy (having spread prolifically from their original system), mynocks tend to flock together, migrating annually in large groups. The most notable of these events are the migrations of Roon, during which the sky darkens from swarms of these creatures. First seen in The Empire Strikes Back feeding on the Millennium Falcon."},{"name":"Sarlacc","image":"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/08/c4/e6/08c4e61ddf79c53386b3f44f45ca70e2.jpg","description":"The sarlacc is an omnivorous, immobile beast, found on several planets, most notably Tatooine. The largest known member of the species resides on Felucia, and is several kilometers long. Jabba the Hutt used to toss his enemies into a sarlacc, which would then slowly digest them for a thousand years. Boba Fett is the only one known to survive the sarlacc. It consists of a single giant beak and many tentacles emerging from the depths of its pit as well as spike-like teeth that help snag onto preys clothes 'like barbed wire' long enough for the tentacles to grab it. Xenobiologists are unsure as to whether the sarlacc is animal or plant, as it possesses characteristics of both kingdoms. They reproduce by spitting out a small dart like object that attaches to a living creature and devours it."},{"name":"Ewok","image":"https://flickreel-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-Green-Light-In-Eternal-Defence-of-the-Ewoks1.jpg","description":"The Ewok is a small, sentient furry creature who lives in trees on the forest moon of Endor."},{"name":"Falumpaset","image":"https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_falumpaset_01_169_b6d46698.jpeg","description":"The Falumpaset is a large mammal native to Naboo. They roamed the plains and swamps of the planet in large herds, and their distinctive call could be heard for kilometers around. Easily domesticated, falumpasets were popular mounts all over the galaxy."}]};
